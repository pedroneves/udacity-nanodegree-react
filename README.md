# About

I've created this repository to store and share my own approaches to the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) projects and exercises.

I've decided to make this public just after the begning of the course, but if you're searching for help and/or have anything to help me along, please, feel free to open an issue and share your thoughts.

# Content

Every project and exercise will have its own branch. The following list is what I've done so far:

1. [Contacts](#contacts)

## Contacts

Create a contact list, where the user can add, filter and remove contacts. This project is based on the [reactnd-contacts-app](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-app), but I've decided to start from scratch, in order to learn all the details, as much as I can.

To access the code, switch to the `contacts-master` branch.
